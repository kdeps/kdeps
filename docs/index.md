# What is Kdeps?

Kdeps is an all-in-one AI framework for building Dockerized full-stack AI applications (FE and BE) that includes
open-source LLM models out-of-the-box.

## Key Features

Kdeps is loaded with powerful features to streamline AI app development. Here are the top highlights, sorted by desirability:

- 🛠️ **Let LLMs run tools automatically (aka MCP or A2A) with [external tools and chained tool workflows](https://kdeps.com/getting-started/resources/llm.html#tools-configuration)** to enhance functionality through scripts and sequential tool pipelines.
- 🧩 **Low-code/no-code capabilities for building [operational full-stack AI apps](https://kdeps.com/getting-started/configuration/workflow.html)**, enabling accessible development for non-technical users and production-ready applications.
- 🐳 **Build [Dockerized full-stack AI apps](https://kdeps.com/getting-started/introduction/quickstart.html#quickstart)** with [batteries included](https://kdeps.com/getting-started/configuration/workflow.html#ai-agent-settings) for seamless development and deployment.
- 🌐 **Pair APIs with [frontend apps](https://kdeps.com/getting-started/configuration/workflow.html#web-server-settings)** like Streamlit, NodeJS, and more for interactive AI-driven user interfaces.
- 🔌 **Create custom [AI APIs](https://kdeps.com/getting-started/configuration/workflow.html#api-server-settings)** that serve [open-source LLMs](https://kdeps.com/getting-started/configuration/workflow.html#llm-models) for robust AI-driven applications.
- 🖼️ Support for [vision or multimodal LLMs](https://kdeps.com/getting-started/resources/multimodal.html), enabling processing of text, images, and other data types in a single workflow.

## Additional Features

- 📊 Generate [structured outputs](https://kdeps.com/getting-started/resources/llm.html#chat-block) from LLMs for consistent, machine-readable responses.
- 📈 Enable context-aware [RAG workflows](https://kdeps.com/getting-started/resources/kartographer.html) for accurate, knowledge-intensive tasks.
- 🗂️ Upload [documents or files](https://kdeps.com/getting-started/tutorials/files.html) for LLM processing, ideal for document analysis.
- 🤖 Leverage multiple open-source LLMs from [Ollama](https://kdeps.com/getting-started/configuration/workflow.html#llm-models) and [Huggingface](https://github.com/kdeps/examples/tree/main/huggingface_imagegen_api).
- 🔄 Use [reusable AI agents](https://kdeps.com/getting-started/resources/remix.html) for flexible workflows.
- 🐍 Execute Python in isolated environments using [Anaconda](https://kdeps.com/getting-started/resources/python.html).
- 🌍 Make [API calls](https://kdeps.com/getting-started/resources/client.html) directly from configuration.
- 🖥️ Run [shell scripts](https://kdeps.com/getting-started/resources/exec.html) seamlessly.
- 💾 Manage state with [memory operations](https://kdeps.com/getting-started/resources/memory.html) to store, retrieve, and clear persistent data.
- ✅ Built-in [API request validations](https://kdeps.com/getting-started/resources/api-request-validations.html#api-request-validations), [custom validation checks](https://kdeps.com/getting-started/resources/validations.html), and [skip conditions](https://kdeps.com/getting-started/resources/skip.html).
- 📁 Serve [static websites](https://kdeps.com/getting-started/configuration/workflow.html#static-file-serving) or [reverse-proxied apps](https://kdeps.com/getting-started/configuration/workflow.html#reverse-proxying).
- 🔒 Configure [CORS rules](https://kdeps.com/getting-started/configuration/workflow.html#cors-configuration) directly in the workflow.
- 🛡️ Set [trusted proxies](https://kdeps.com/getting-started/configuration/workflow.html#trustedproxies) for enhanced API and frontend security.
- 🚀 Run in [Lambda mode](https://kdeps.com/getting-started/configuration/workflow.html#lambda-mode) or [API mode](https://kdeps.com/getting-started/configuration/workflow.html#api-server-settings).
- 📦 Install [Ubuntu packages](https://kdeps.com/getting-started/configuration/workflow.html#ubuntu-packages) via configuration.
- 📜 Define [Ubuntu repositories or PPAs](https://kdeps.com/getting-started/configuration/workflow.html#ubuntu-repositories).
