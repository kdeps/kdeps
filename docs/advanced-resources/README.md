### **Tool Calling (MCP) (`tools.md`)**
**Model Context Protocol Integration and Function Calling**

The Tool Calling resource integrates external tools and functions through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Provides:
- Seamless integration with external tools and APIs
- Function calling from LLM conversations
- Real-time data access and manipulation
- Custom tool development and integration
- Secure tool execution environment

**Use Cases**: Dynamic data access, real-time calculations, external system integration, enhanced LLM capabilities

**Example Applications**:
- Weather data integration for conversational AI
- Calculator and math tools for problem solving
- Database queries from natural language
- File system operations through chat interfaces

### **Items Iteration (`items.md`)**
**Batch Processing and Collection Handling**

The Items resource enables batch processing and iteration over collections of data. Features include:
- Parallel processing of data collections
- Configurable batch sizes and processing limits
- Error handling for individual items
- Progress tracking and monitoring
- Memory-efficient streaming processing

**Use Cases**: Data transformation, bulk operations, report generation, content processing, ETL workflows

**Example Applications**:
- Bulk email processing and categorization
- Large dataset analysis and transformation
- Content migration and conversion
- Automated report generation from data collections

## Advanced Workflow Patterns

### **Multi-Modal Content Pipeline**
```apl
// Process images with descriptions, then generate related content
Requires { "imageAnalysisResource"; "contentGenerationResource" }
```

### **Content Generation Workflow**
```apl
// Generate images based on LLM descriptions
Requires { "llmResource"; "imageGeneratorResource"; "responseResource" }
```

### **Tool-Enhanced Conversations**
```apl
// LLM with access to real-time tools and data
Requires { "toolCallingResource"; "llmResource" }
```

### **Batch Content Processing**
```apl
// Process collections of content with AI analysis
Requires { "itemsIterationResource"; "multimodalResource" }
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Resource Usage**: Advanced resources may require more CPU/GPU/memory
- **Processing Time**: Complex AI operations may have longer execution times
- **Rate Limiting**: Consider API limits when using external models or services
- **Caching**: Implement caching strategies for expensive operations

## Integration with Core Resources

Advanced resources work seamlessly with core resources:

- **Combine with LLM**: Enhance language models with vision, tools, or generation capabilities
- **API Integration**: Use with HTTP Client for external service integration
- **Data Processing**: Combine with Python for custom preprocessing or postprocessing
- **Response Formatting**: Use with Response resource for structured output
