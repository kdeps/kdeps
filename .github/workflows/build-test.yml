    # E2E tests might require more setup (Docker, etc). 
    # For now, let's verify if we can run them. 
    # The 'run.go' mentions docker-compose.
    # Let's skip E2E for basic CI to ensure stability first, or try it.
    # The project seems to claim local-first, so maybe E2E runs locally?
    # Let's stick to unit/integration for now.
