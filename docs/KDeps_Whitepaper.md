## Introduction

### About the name

> “KDeps, short for ‘knowledge dependencies,’ is inspired by the principle that knowledge—whether from AI, machines, or humans—can be represented, organized, orchestrated, and interacted with through graph-based systems. The name grew out of my work on Kartographer, a lightweight graph library for organizing and interacting with information. KDeps builds on Kartographer’s foundation and serves as a RAG-first (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) AI agent framework.” — Joel Bryan Juliano, KDeps creator

### Why Offline-First?

Organizations increasingly require AI systems that can operate securely, reliably, and predictably without cloud dependencies. Offline-first design provides:

- **Privacy and compliance**: Data remains on-premises to satisfy PII, GDPR, HIPAA, and enterprise policies
- **Reliability**: Applications continue functioning during outages or network degradation
- **Low latency**: Local inference eliminates network round-trips for faster responses
- **Predictable cost**: No per-token fees or vendor subscriptions; models run locally
- **Control and independence**: Avoids vendor lock-in and enables reproducible deployments
- **Data residency**: Meets jurisdictional requirements by processing data locally
- **Security**: Reduces external attack surface by removing third-party AI API dependencies
- **Edge readiness**: Processes data near its source for real-time use cases

KDeps enables offline-first operation by integrating open-source LLMs (via Ollama) and packaging complete applications—including models and runtimes—into Docker images. No external AI APIs are required in production.

### Problem Statement

The current landscape of AI application development presents significant challenges:

- **Complexity**: Building applications with integrated AI capabilities requires expertise in multiple domains including machine learning, infrastructure, API development, and frontend development
- **Infrastructure Overhead**: Deploying and managing AI models as part of applications requires substantial infrastructure setup and maintenance
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Many AI platforms create dependencies on proprietary services and APIs
- **Scalability Issues**: Traditional application architectures struggle with scaling AI components and resource management
- **Development Velocity**: The time-to-market for applications with AI features is often extended due to integration complexity

### Core Design Principles

1. **Declarative Configuration**: All application logic is defined through PKL configuration files
2. **Dependency Resolution**: Resources are executed based on a directed acyclic graph (DAG)
3. **Containerization**: Complete applications are packaged as self-contained Docker images
4. **Modularity**: Resources can be composed, reused, and remixed across applications
5. **Type Safety**: PKL provides compile-time validation of configurations

## Core Components

### 1. Workflow Engine

The workflow engine is the central orchestrator of KDeps applications. It manages:

- **Configuration Loading**: Parses PKL workflow files and validates configurations
- **Resource Resolution**: Determines execution order based on dependencies
- **State Management**: Handles application state and memory operations
- **Error Handling**: Provides comprehensive error reporting and recovery

**Key Features:**
- Support for both API server and Lambda execution modes
- Integrated CORS and security configurations
- Multi-model LLM support
- Custom package and repository management

### 2. Resource System

Resources are the fundamental building blocks of KDeps applications. Each resource represents a discrete unit of functionality:

**Resource Types:**
- **LLM Resources**: Interface with language models for text generation and analysis
- **HTTP Resources**: Make external API calls and handle web requests
- **Python Resources**: Execute Python code in isolated Anaconda environments
- **Exec Resources**: Run shell commands and system operations
- **Response Resources**: Format and return API responses
- **Data Resources**: Manage file operations and data persistence
- **Memory Resources**: Persistent state management with SQLite backend
- **Session Resources**: User session data and temporary state
- **Tool Resources**: Script execution and tool management

**Resource Characteristics:**
- Unique ActionID for identification
- Dependency declarations for execution ordering
- Validation and preflight checks with custom error handling
- Conditional execution logic with skip conditions
- Timeout and error handling
- Asynchronous processing with goroutines
- Base64 encoding support for binary data
- Environment variable management

### 3. Dependency Resolver

The dependency resolver implements a sophisticated graph-based execution engine powered by the Kartographer library:

**Features:**
- **DAG Construction**: Builds dependency graphs from resource declarations
- **Topological Sorting**: Determines optimal execution order
- **Cycle Detection**: Prevents circular dependencies
- **Parallel Execution**: Runs independent resources concurrently
- **Error Propagation**: Handles failures gracefully across the dependency chain
- **Resource Isolation**: Each resource ID can only be used once per workflow to prevent complex dependency issues
- **Sequential Execution**: Resources execute in top-down queue manner for predictable behavior

**Dependency Management:**
```pkl
// Example dependency chain
Requires {
    "llmResource"      // First: LLM processing
    "pythonResource"   // Second: Data transformation
    "httpResource"     // Third: External API call
}
// Target: responseResource (executed last)
```

**Resource Reusability:**
- Resources can be remixed and reused across different workflows
- External agents can be imported and referenced with versioning
- Support for agent composition and modular design

### 4. Docker Integration

PreflightCheck {
    Validations {
        "@(request.filecount())" > 0
        "@(request.data().query.length)" > 5
        "@(request.filetype('document'))" == "image/jpeg"
    }
    Error {
        Code = 422
        Message = "Invalid input: File required and query must be at least 5 characters"
    }
}

// Skip conditions for conditional execution

    "@(request.data().priority)" == "low"
}
```

**Validation Features:**

### 8. State Management and Persistence

KDeps provides comprehensive state management capabilities:

```pkl
// Memory operations for persistent state
Expr {
    "@(memory.setRecord('user_preferences', request.data().preferences))"
}

// Session management for temporary state
local sessionData = "@(session.getRecord('current_user'))"

// Tool execution history
local toolResult = "@(tool.run('script_name', 'parameters'))"
```

**State Management Features:**
- **Memory Resources**: Persistent SQLite-based storage

    "A long, long time ago"
    "I can still remember"
    "How that music used to make me smile"
    "And I knew if I had my chance"
}

run {
    SkipCondition {
        item.current() == "And I knew if I had my chance"
    }
    Chat {
        Model = "llama3.2:1b"
        Prompt = "Generate MTV scenario for: @(item.current())"
        Scenario {
            new { Role = "system"; Prompt = "Previous: @(item.prev())" }

// Promise operator ensures deferred execution
local response = "@(llm.response('chatResource'))"
local filePath = "@(data.filepath('tools/1.0.0', 'script.py'))"

// Skip conditions with promises
SkipCondition {
    "@(request.data().priority)" == "low"
}

// Preflight validations with promises
PreflightCheck {
    Validations {
        "@(request.filecount())" > 0
