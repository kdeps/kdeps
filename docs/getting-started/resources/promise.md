# Promise Operator

Kdeps uses the `"@()"` post-execution template convention to defer the execution of resource functions to a later stage.

Since Kdeps relies on a number of [Apple PKL](https://pkl-lang.org) functions, any function that depends on values
generated during resource execution must be wrapped in this template convention.

> *Note:* The `"@()"` operator must always be enclosed in double quotes. In Apple PKL, it is treated as a string, which is
> later post-processed by Kdeps.

Without the promise operator, such functions would execute prematurely, causing an exception.

The promise operator is commonly used in [Resources](../resources/resources.md). Below are examples of its applications:

## Skip Condition

Each resource includes a `skipCondition` block that, when evaluated as `true`, skips the resource's execution.

In this example, the `@(request.path())` expression is wrapped with the promise operator to ensure the value is deferred:

```apl
local allowedPath = "/api/v1/items"
local requestPath = "@(request.path())"

SkipCondition {
    requestPath != allowedPath
}
```

## Preflight Validations

In this scenario, a resource requires the uploaded file attachment to be of specific typesâ€”PDF, PNG, or JPEG.

The promise operator is used to evaluate the MIME type of the uploaded file, as shown below:

```apl
local fileType = "@(request.filetypes()[0])"

PreflightCheck {
    Validations {
        fileType == "application/pdf" || fileType == "image/png" || fileType == "image/jpeg"
    }
}
```

## Resource Functions

All resource functions must use the promise operator. For further information, see the [Functions](../resources/functions) documentation.

## API Request Functions

Similarly, API request functions require the promise operator. For additional details, refer to the [API Request Functions](../resources/functions#api-request-functions) documentation.
